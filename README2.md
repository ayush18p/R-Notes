### Data Visualization in R

R provides a variety of tools for data visualization, allowing users to represent their data graphically. Below are the most common types of plots in R, including examples and explanations.

### 1. **Bar Plot**
Bar plots are used to display categorical data. The height or length of each bar corresponds to the value or frequency of the category. 

- **Horizontal Bar Plot:**
  This format displays the bars horizontally, making long category names easier to read.
  
  **Example:**
  ```r
  barplot(d$Ozone, main = 'Ozone Concentration in Air', xlab = 'Ozone Levels', horiz = TRUE)
  ```

- **Vertical Bar Plot:**
  This plot displays the data with vertical bars.
  
  **Example:**
  ```r
  barplot(d$Ozone, main = 'Ozone Concentration in Air', xlab = 'Ozone Levels', col = 'blue', horiz = FALSE)
  ```

### 2. **Histogram**
Histograms display the distribution of continuous data by dividing it into intervals or bins. The height of each bar reflects the number of observations within each bin.

- **Example:**
  ```r
  hist(d$Temp, main = "La Guardia Airport's Maximum Temperature (Daily)", 
       xlab = "Temperature (Fahrenheit)", xlim = c(50, 125), col = "yellow", freq = TRUE)
  ```

### 3. **Box Plot**
A box plot visualizes the distribution of data based on the five-number summary: minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum. It also helps in identifying outliers.

- **Single Box Plot:**
  
  **Example:**
  ```r
  boxplot(d$Wind, main = "Average Wind Speed at La Guardia Airport", 
          xlab = "Miles per Hour", ylab = "Wind", col = "orange", border = "brown", 
          horizontal = TRUE, notch = TRUE)
  ```

- **Multiple Box Plots:**
  
  **Example:**
  ```r
  boxplot(d[, 0:4], main = 'Box Plots for Air Quality Parameters')
  ```

### 4. **Scatter Plot**
A scatter plot is used to show the relationship between two continuous variables. Each point represents an observation.

- **Example:**
  ```r
  plot(d$Ozone, d$Month, main = "Scatterplot Example", 
       xlab = "Ozone Concentration in Parts per Billion", 
       ylab = "Month of Observation", pch = "X")
  ```

### Map Visualization in R

Map visualization in R allows you to represent geographical data on a map. Using the `maps` package, you can create visualizations such as world maps or country-specific maps. R also supports marking points, adding layers, and color-coding regions based on data values.

#### Steps for Map Visualization:

1. **Install and Load the Required Libraries:**
   First, you need to install the `maps` package if itâ€™s not already installed:
   ```r
   install.packages("maps")
   library(maps)
   ```

2. **Load the Dataset:**
   You need to have a dataset containing latitude and longitude information for the locations you want to visualize. You can load the dataset into a data frame:
   ```r
   data <- read.csv("worldcities.csv")
   df <- data.frame(data)
   ```

3. **Draw the World Map:**
   To draw a basic world map, use the `map()` function:
   ```r
   map(database = "world")
   ```

4. **Mark Points on the Map:**
   To mark specific locations (e.g., cities), you can use the `points()` function, passing in the latitude and longitude values from the dataset:
   ```r
   points(x = df$lat[1:500], y = df$lng[1:500], col = "Red")
   ```
   In this example, the first 500 cities are plotted on the world map, with the points colored red. You can modify the color and size of the points based on your needs.

#### Customizations:
- **Database:** You can use databases other than `"world"`, such as `"state"` or `"county"`, to focus on a specific region.
- **Color:** The `col` argument allows you to specify the color of the points or regions.
- **Labels:** You can use text functions to label the cities, countries, or regions on the map.

Map visualizations are useful for tracking locations, visualizing geographic data distributions, and presenting insights such as population density, resource allocation, and travel routes.

### Pie Chart in R

Pie charts represent the proportions of different categories within a dataset, shown as slices of a circle. Each slice corresponds to the relative frequency or value of the category it represents.

#### Creating a Pie Chart:

1. **Create the Data:**
   Define the values and corresponding labels for each slice of the pie chart.
   ```r
   x <- c(20, 65, 15, 50) 
   labels <- c("India", "America", "Sri Lanka", "Nepal")
   ```

2. **Plot the Pie Chart:**
   Use the `pie()` function to create a basic pie chart:
   ```r
   pie(x, labels, main = "Country Pie Chart", col = rainbow(length(x)))
   ```

   - **x:** The numeric values representing the size of each slice.
   - **labels:** The names or categories corresponding to the slices.
   - **main:** The title of the pie chart.
   - **col:** The `rainbow()` function is used to assign different colors to each slice.

#### Adding Percentages to the Pie Chart:

You can calculate the percentage of each slice and display it on the chart:
```r
pie_percent <- round(100 * x / sum(x), 1)  # Calculate percentages
pie(x, labels = pie_percent, main = "Country Pie Chart", col = rainbow(length(x)))
```
This code snippet calculates the percentage of each value in the pie chart and displays it as a label.

#### Adding a Legend:
A legend can be added to help readers understand which slice corresponds to which category:
```r
legend("topright", c("India", "America", "Sri Lanka", "Nepal"), fill = rainbow(length(x)))
```
The `legend()` function specifies the location of the legend (`"topright"` in this case) and the colors corresponding to each category.

### 3D Pie Chart in R

A 3D pie chart adds depth to the standard pie chart, giving a more dynamic and visually appealing representation of the data. In R, you can create 3D pie charts using the `plotrix` package.

#### Steps to Create a 3D Pie Chart:

1. **Install and Load the `plotrix` Package:**
   If you don't have the `plotrix` package installed, install it first:
   ```r
   install.packages("plotrix")
   library(plotrix)
   ```

2. **Create the Data:**
   Define the values and labels for the pie chart:
   ```r
   x <- c(20, 65, 15, 50) 
   labels <- c("India", "America", "Sri Lanka", "Nepal")
   ```

3. **Create the 3D Pie Chart:**
   Use the `pie3D()` function to generate a 3D pie chart:
   ```r
   pie3D(x, labels = labels, explode = 0.1, main = "Country Pie Chart")
   ```

   - **x:** The numeric values representing the size of each slice.
   - **labels:** The names or categories corresponding to the slices.
   - **explode:** This argument separates the slices from each other. A value like `0.1` adds space between the slices.
   - **main:** The title of the pie chart.

#### Customizations for 3D Pie Charts:
- **Depth Effect:** The depth of the 3D effect can be customized using the `explode` argument.
- **Labels as Percentages:** You can display the percentage value for each slice instead of just the category label:
   ```r
   pie_percent <- round(100 * x / sum(x), 1) 
   pie3D(x, labels = pie_percent, explode = 0.1, main = "Country Pie Chart")
   ```

#### Adding a Legend to a 3D Pie Chart:
Just like in a standard pie chart, you can add a legend:
```r
legend("topright", c("India", "America", "Sri Lanka", "Nepal"), fill = rainbow(length(x)))
```

3D pie charts are helpful for presentations where visual appeal is important, but they can sometimes be harder to interpret accurately due to the added depth.

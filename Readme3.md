### **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**

**Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** is a type of feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) that consists of multiple layers of nodes (neurons). It is capable of learning complex patterns by using **non-linear activation functions** and **multiple layers** of neurons, unlike a single-layer perceptron, which can only solve linearly separable problems.

#### **Key Components of MLP:**
1. **Input Layer**: 
   - This layer receives the input features from the data. Each neuron in this layer corresponds to one feature of the input data.
  
2. **Hidden Layer(s)**:
   - MLP contains one or more hidden layers between the input and output layers. These layers add complexity to the model, allowing it to capture non-linear relationships in the data.
   
3. **Output Layer**:
   - The final layer in the network provides the prediction or classification based on the learned weights and inputs from previous layers.

4. **Activation Functions**:
   - **Non-linear activation functions** such as ReLU, Sigmoid, or Tanh are applied at each neuron in the hidden layers to introduce non-linearity, enabling the MLP to learn more complex patterns.
  
5. **Weights and Biases**:
   - Each connection between neurons has an associated weight, and each neuron typically has a bias term. The MLP adjusts these during training to minimize the error in predictions.

#### **MLP Structure**:
An MLP with one hidden layer has the following structure:
- Input: \( X = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) \)
- Hidden layer (with activation function): \( Z^{(1)} = f(W^{(1)} X + b^{(1)}) \)
- Output layer: \( Z^{(2)} = g(W^{(2)} Z^{(1)} + b^{(2)}) \)

Where:
- \( W^{(1)} \) and \( W^{(2)} \) are the weight matrices for the hidden and output layers.
- \( b^{(1)} \) and \( b^{(2)} \) are the biases for each layer.
- \( f \) and \( g \) are activation functions, commonly ReLU for hidden layers and softmax/sigmoid for output layers.

### **Key Differences between MLP and Single-Layer Perceptron (SLP)**

#### **1. Structure**:
- **Single-layer Perceptron**: Has only one layer of neurons (the output layer) directly connected to the input. It cannot have hidden layers.
- **Multilayer Perceptron**: Contains multiple layers, including one or more hidden layers between input and output.

#### **2. Linearly Separable vs. Non-linearly Separable Problems**:
- **SLP**: Can only solve linearly separable problems using a linear decision boundary.
  
  **Equation**:
  \[
  y = f(WX + b)
  \]
  where \( f \) is a step or sign function (typically a linear activation function).

- **MLP**: Can solve both linearly separable and non-linearly separable problems due to the non-linear activation functions and hidden layers.

  **Equation**:
  For an MLP with one hidden layer, the equations are:
  \[
  Z^{(1)} = f(W^{(1)}X + b^{(1)})
  \]
  \[
  Z^{(2)} = g(W^{(2)}Z^{(1)} + b^{(2)})
  \]
  Here, \( f \) is typically non-linear (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid).

#### **3. Computational Complexity**:
- **SLP**: Simpler with faster computation, but limited in its ability to capture complex relationships.
- **MLP**: More computationally expensive due to the multiple layers and non-linear transformations, but able to learn more intricate patterns.

#### **4. Universal Approximation**:
- **SLP**: Limited in expressiveness. It cannot approximate non-linear functions.
- **MLP**: Theoretically proven to be a **universal approximator** with sufficient neurons in the hidden layer. This means it can approximate any continuous function to a desired accuracy given enough resources.

#### **5. Learning Algorithm**:
- **SLP**: Typically uses a simple learning algorithm like the **perceptron learning rule**.
- **MLP**: Uses **backpropagation** with gradient descent to minimize the loss function, adjusting weights and biases.

### **MLP Training**:
The training of MLP involves minimizing a **loss function** (like mean squared error or cross-entropy) by adjusting the weights through **backpropagation**. The backpropagation process calculates the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight and uses gradient descent to update the weights.

### **MLP Example**:
Suppose you have a binary classification problem where the input data \( X \) is not linearly separable. A single-layer perceptron fails to classify the data accurately, but an MLP with one hidden layer and ReLU activation can create non-linear decision boundaries and classify the data correctly.

### **Equations**:
For a simple MLP with one hidden layer, the computations proceed as follows:
1. Compute the weighted sum for the hidden layer:
   \[
   Z^{(1)} = f(W^{(1)} X + b^{(1)})
   \]
   where \( f \) is a non-linear activation function like ReLU.
   
2. Compute the output:
   \[
   Z^{(2)} = g(W^{(2)} Z^{(1)} + b^{(2)})
   \]
   where \( g \) is typically a softmax or sigmoid activation for classification tasks.

In **Deep Learning**, optimizers adjust the modelâ€™s parameters (weights and biases) to minimize the loss function. They update parameters using gradients calculated during backpropagation. Below are the most commonly used optimizers, summarized.

### 1. **Gradient Descent**
**Gradient Descent** iteratively updates parameters in the direction of the negative gradient to minimize the loss function.

**Types**:
- **Batch Gradient Descent**: Updates using the entire dataset.
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: Updates using one sample, leading to faster but noisier updates.
- **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent**: Uses small data batches, balancing speed and accuracy.

**Equation**:
\[
\theta = \theta - \eta \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta)
\]
Where:
- \( \theta \): model parameters,
- \( \eta \): learning rate,
- \( \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta) \): gradient of loss function.

### 2. **Momentum**
Momentum adds a term that speeds up learning by dampening oscillations, moving faster in the direction of consistent gradients.

**Equation**:
\[
v_t = \beta v_{t-1} + (1 - \beta) \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta)
\]
\[
\theta = \theta - \eta v_t
\]
Where \( \beta \) is the momentum factor.

### 3. **Adagrad**
Adagrad adjusts the learning rate for each parameter individually, making larger updates for infrequent parameters and smaller updates for frequent ones.

**Equation**:
\[
\theta = \theta - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{G_t + \epsilon}} \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta)
\]
Where \( G_t \) is the sum of squared gradients.

### 4. **RMSprop**
RMSprop maintains a moving average of squared gradients to adjust the learning rate, solving the learning rate decay problem in Adagrad.

**Equation**:
\[
\theta = \theta - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{E[g^2]_t + \epsilon}} \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta)
\]

### 5. **Adam**
Adam combines Momentum and RMSprop, maintaining both first and second moments (mean and variance) of gradients.

**Equation**:
\[
m_t = \beta_1 m_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_1) \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta)
\]
\[
v_t = \beta_2 v_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_2) (\nabla_{\theta} J(\theta))^2
\]
\[
\theta = \theta - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{\hat{v_t}} + \epsilon} \hat{m_t}
\]
Adam is versatile and works well across a wide variety of tasks.

### 6. **Nadam**
Nadam combines Adam with Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG), offering better performance in certain tasks.

**Equation**:
\[
\theta = \theta - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{v_t} + \epsilon} (\beta_1 m_t + (1 - \beta_1) \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta))
\]

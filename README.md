### Introduction to R
R is a powerful programming language and environment specifically designed for statistical computing and data visualization. It is widely used by statisticians, data analysts, and researchers to perform data analysis, statistical modeling, and create advanced graphical representations. R comes with a vast collection of libraries and tools, making it highly efficient for both simple and complex statistical operations.

### Variable Declaration and Data Types

#### Variable Declaration:
Variables in R are declared using the assignment operator `<-`. For example, to store the sum of two numbers:

```r
a <- 6
b <- 7
c <- a + b
print(c) # Output: 13
```

#### Data Types:
R supports a variety of data types, each suited for specific tasks:

- **Numeric:** Holds decimal values.
  ```r
  x <- 10.5
  class(x) # Output: "numeric"
  ```
  
- **Integer:** Represents whole numbers by adding an `L`.
  ```r
  x <- 1000L
  class(x) # Output: "integer"
  ```
  
- **Complex:** Stores complex numbers.
  ```r
  x <- 9i + 3
  class(x) # Output: "complex"
  ```
  
- **Character/String:** Stores text.
  ```r
  x <- "R is exciting"
  class(x) # Output: "character"
  ```
  
- **Logical/Boolean:** Represents logical values.
  ```r
  x <- TRUE
  class(x) # Output: "logical"
  ```

---

### String Operations
R allows operations on strings, including:

- **Finding the length of a string** using `nchar()`:
  ```r
  str <- "Hello, World!"
  nchar(str) # Output: 13
  ```

- **Checking for a sequence in a string** using `grepl()`:
  ```r
  grepl("H", "Hello World!") # Output: TRUE
  grepl("X", "Hello World!") # Output: FALSE
  ```

---

### Loops in R

#### For Loop:
R offers loops to iterate over a sequence of elements. For example, using a `for` loop to print numbers from 1 to 10:
```r
for (x in 1:10) {
  print(x)
}
```

#### String Concatenation:
Strings in R can be concatenated using the `paste()` function:
```r
text1 <- "R is"
text2 <- "awesome"
paste(text1, text2) # Output: "R is awesome"
```

---

### Data Structures in R
R provides several data structures to handle different types of data efficiently:

#### Vectors:
- **Definition:** Vectors store elements of the same type (numeric, character, or logical).
- **Creation:** You can create a vector using the `c()` function:
  ```r
  fruits <- c("banana", "apple", "orange")
  numbers <- c(1, 2, 3)
  ```

#### Lists:
- **Definition:** Lists can store elements of different types (e.g., numbers, strings, and even other lists).
- **Creation:** You can create a list using the `list()` function:
  ```r
  my_list <- list("apple", 5, TRUE)
  ```

#### Matrices:
- **Definition:** A matrix is a two-dimensional array where all elements are of the same type.
- **Creation:** You can create a matrix using the `matrix()` function:
  ```r
  M <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
  ```

#### Arrays:
- **Definition:** Arrays are multi-dimensional extensions of matrices.
- **Creation:** You can create an array using the `array()` function:
  ```r
  arr <- array(c(1:8), dim = c(2, 2, 2))
  ```

#### Data Frames:
- **Definition:** Data frames are similar to matrices but can store different types of data in each column.
- **Creation:** You can create a data frame using the `data.frame()` function:
  ```r
  df <- data.frame(
    Name = c("John", "Jane", "Tom"),
    Age = c(23, 29, 35),
    Gender = c("Male", "Female", "Male")
  )
  ```

### Statistical Analysis Using R

R is known for its wide range of statistical tools, ranging from simple descriptive statistics to advanced analyses.

#### Descriptive Statistics:
Descriptive statistics help summarize data, providing insights into the central tendencies and variability.

- **Mean:** Represents the average of a dataset.
  ```r
  mean(df$Age) # Example: Calculates mean of Age column
  ```

- **Median:** The middle value of the dataset.
  ```r
  median(df$Age)
  ```

- **Range:** The minimum and maximum values.
  ```r
  range(df$Age)
  ```

- **Standard Deviation and Variance:** Measures the spread or dispersion of the data.
  ```r
  sd(df$Age)
  var(df$Age)
  ```

- **Covariance:** Measures how two variables move together.
  ```r
  cov(df$Age, df$Gender) # Only valid for numerical variables
  ```

---

### Handling Data Files
R provides easy ways to import, examine, and manipulate data.

- **Reading a CSV file:**
  ```r
  d <- read.csv('file.csv')
  ```

- **Examining the structure of the dataset:**
  ```r
  str(d) # Displays structure
  ```

- **Summary of the dataset:**
  ```r
  summary(d) # Summary of all variables
  ```

---

### Working with Missing Data

In many datasets, there will be missing values. R allows you to handle these efficiently.

- **Checking for missing values:** 
  ```r
  is.na(d$Age)
  ```

- **Handling missing values:** You can either remove or replace missing values in your dataset.

---

### Subsetting Data

Subsetting is useful when you want to work with a specific portion of your dataset.

- **Example: Extract all rows where age is greater than 30:**
  ```r
  subset(d, Age > 30)
  ```

---

### Data Visualization in R

R provides various tools for visualizing data:

#### Box Plot:
A box plot shows the distribution of a dataset by displaying the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.

```r
boxplot(d$Age, main = "Age Distribution", xlab = "Age", col = "lightblue")
```

#### Histogram:
A histogram shows the frequency distribution of a dataset.

```r
hist(d$Age, main = "Age Histogram", xlab = "Age", col = "yellow")
```

#### Scatter Plot:
A scatter plot shows the relationship between two variables.

```r
plot(d$Age, d$Salary, main = "Age vs Salary", xlab = "Age", ylab = "Salary", pch = 19)
```

---

### Advanced Statistical Functions

R also supports advanced statistical functions:

- **T-tests:** Used to compare means between two groups.
  ```r
  t.test(group1, group2)
  ```

- **Linear Regression:** Models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
  ```r
  model <- lm(Salary ~ Age + Experience, data = d)
  summary(model)
  ```

With its comprehensive statistical functions, robust data structures, and powerful visualization tools, R is a versatile and essential tool for statisticians, data scientists, and researchers.
